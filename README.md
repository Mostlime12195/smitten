# Smitten

A game engine in your browser. Write Lua, draw pixel art, paint tile maps,
make sound effects and music, and publish the game, all in one tab with
nothing to install. Underneath it's the real [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) 12
engine, compiled to WebAssembly, so everything LÖVE can do, a Smitten game
can do too.

Smitten's engine and editor started from the code of
[Cupid](https://github.com/Mostlime12195/cupid), which brings LÖVE 12 to the
web with a Lua-to-WebAssembly JIT. Smitten is a separate project built on
that code, and neither is affiliated with the LÖVE team.

## What you get

- **An editor** with code, a file panel, the running game and a console side
  by side. Projects live in your browser.
- **Built-in tools** that open the files they make:
  - a **pixel editor** for sprites and animations (`.png` + `.sprite.json`)
  - a **map editor** for tile maps and objects (`.map.json`), and a tileset
    editor for tile properties such as `solid` (`.tileset.json`)
  - a **sound effect editor** in the style of sfxr (`.sfx.json`)
  - a **music editor** with a piano roll, instruments, patterns and an
    arrangement (`.song.json`)
- **The `smitten` module**, a global like `love`, which loads what the tools
  make and adds what most games need:
  ```lua
  local hero = smitten.sprite("sprites/hero"):animation("run")
  local level = smitten.map("maps/level1")
  smitten.sfx("sfx/jump"):play()
  smitten.song("music/theme"):play()
  smitten.input.bind("jump", { "space", "pad:a" })
  smitten.scene.switch(Title)
  local hit = smitten.collide.move(level, player, dx, dy)
  ```
- **A friendlier Lua**: `score += 10`, `continue`, `` `HP: {hp}` `` and
  `if a then b else c` expressions, compiled by the engine's own parser (see
  "Smitten syntax").
- **Pixel-first defaults**: the templates draw at 320×180 scaled up by whole
  numbers, with a 16-color palette, but any image, resolution or sound file
  works.
- **Publishing**: a web build ready for itch.io, a project zip, share links
  for small games, and a `.love` for games that don't use Smitten's
  additions.

`docs/reference.md` documents the file formats, the `smitten` module and the
interface the editor's tools implement. `DESIGN.md` explains the decisions
behind Smitten.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/` | Build output: `index.html` (editor), `player.html`, `love.mjs` + `love.wasm` (engine), `synth.mjs` (the synthesizer, for the editor), `examples/` |
| `love/` | LÖVE source (upstream commit `ef388d4`) with Cupid's web patches |
| `love/src/modules/smitten/` | The `smitten` module: C++ (the synthesizer) and Lua (`lua/*.lua`, embedded by `build.py`) |
| `deps/lua-5.1.5/` | PUC Lua 5.1.5 with LuaJIT's extensions, the JIT and Smitten's syntax |
| `deps/theora/` | libtheora 1.2.0 decoder, for `love.video` |
| `web/native/` | Web entry point (`web_main.cpp`) replacing LÖVE's blocking `main()` |
| `web/player/` | The player page (standalone and embeddable) |
| `web/editor/` | The editor; its tools are in `web/editor/tools/` |
| `web/examples/` | Example projects |
| `build.py` | Build script (reads source lists from `love/CMakeLists.txt`) |
| `serve.py` | Local dev server |
| `package.py` | Command-line web export for a game folder or `.love` |
| `tools/` | Test games (`smitten-sprite`, `smitten-map`, `smitten-audio`, and Cupid's `bench`, `smoke`, `threads`, ...), the JIT's test suite and `test_server.py` |

## Performance

Lua runs on PUC Lua 5.1 plus a JIT that compiles hot functions to
WebAssembly: 1.7–5.6× faster than the plain interpreter on Lua-heavy code
(Cupid's README has the full measurements). Drawing, physics, audio and
image decoding are LÖVE's own C++ code, batched into WebGL 2. Compared with
desktop LÖVE on LuaJIT, pure-Lua code is slower and engine-side work is
about the same, so games that spend their frame drawing lose little.

## Threads without SharedArrayBuffer

Browsers can't block the main thread, and real threads need cross-origin
isolation headers that many hosts don't send. Instead, each `love.thread`
Thread gets its own Lua state and runs as a coroutine on the main thread
(`love/src/modules/thread/web/GreenThreads.cpp`):

- Threads are preempted by an instruction-count hook (Lua 5.1 can yield from
  hooks), so even `while true do ... end` worker loops don't freeze the page.
- `Channel:demand`, `Channel:supply`, `Thread:wait` and `love.timer.sleep`
  yield the thread until they can complete.
- When the main thread blocks (for example `channel:demand()` in
  `love.load`), other threads run until it can continue. A real deadlock
  raises an error instead of hanging the tab.
- Threads get whatever time is left in each 60 Hz frame after the game's
  update and draw (2 to 12 ms).

The trade-off: threads share one CPU core with the game, so they make
blocking-style code work but don't add parallel speed.

## Lua compatibility

Desktop LÖVE runs LuaJIT, which is Lua 5.1 plus extensions. Smitten runs PUC
Lua 5.1.5 with the LuaJIT 2.1 extensions that games and libraries commonly
use added back (`deps/lua-5.1.5`), so code written for desktop LÖVE loads
and behaves the same:

| Extension | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `goto` and `::labels::` | Lua 5.2 rules: no jumping into a local's scope, labels are visible in nested blocks, `goto continue` to a label at the end of a loop works |
| `\xXX`, `\z` and `\u{XXXX}` string escapes | |
| `coroutine.yield` inside `pcall`/`xpcall` | Inside a coroutine the function runs in a child coroutine that passes yields through. `coroutine.running`/`status` report the parent; `xpcall` handlers run at the error, so `debug.traceback` shows the failing code. Outside coroutines `pcall` is the plain C function, at full speed |
| `load(string [, name [, mode [, env]]])`, `loadfile(name, mode, env)` | |
| `xpcall(f, handler, ...)` | Passes the extra arguments to `f` |
| `math.log(x, base)`, `string.rep(s, n, sep)` | |
| `string.format`: `%s` uses `__tostring` and accepts any value; `%a` | |
| `table.move`, `require("table.new")`, `require("table.clear")` | |
| `coroutine.isyieldable`, `package.searchpath`, `os.exit(true/false)` | |
| `bit` | LuaBitOp, as on LuaJIT |

What can't work in a browser fails with a message that says why, instead of
a generic error:

- `require("ffi")`, `require("jit")`, `jit.*` modules and `string.buffer`:
  "isn't available on the web: it's part of LuaJIT ...". The `jit` global is
  nil, so libraries that check `if jit then` take their plain-Lua path.
- `require("socket")`, `"enet"` and LuaSocket's other modules: browsers have
  no raw sockets; use `require("https")`.
- 64-bit literals (`1LL`, `1ULL`) and imaginary literals (`2i`): a syntax
  error that names LuaJIT's FFI.
- Yielding inside a metamethod, a `for ... in` iterator or a C function such
  as `table.sort`'s comparator: the error says that yielding works inside
  `pcall` but not there. (LuaJIT allows the first two.)

### Smitten syntax

Smitten's parser also accepts four pieces of Luau syntax. Each compiles to
the bytecode Lua 5.1 already has (no new opcodes), so the JIT, debug hooks,
coroutines and error messages work as for any other code, and line numbers
are the source's. Every program that ran before still compiles to the same
bytecode.

| Syntax | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compound assignment | `score += 10`, `name ..= "!"`, also `-= *= /= %= ^=` | One variable (local, upvalue, global, field or index); in `t[f()] += 1`, `t` and `f()` are evaluated once |
| `continue` | `for i = 1, n do if skip(i) then continue end ... end` | Jumps to the end of the loop body (the condition in `repeat ... until`, which can't use a local the `continue` skipped). Like `break`, it ends its block. Only a keyword when it stands alone: `continue = 1`, `t.continue`, `::continue::` and `goto continue` still work |
| String interpolation | `` `HP: {hp}/{maxHp}` `` | Each `{expression}` is converted by the original `tostring` (replacing the global doesn't change it). `\{` writes a brace; the usual escapes work. A backtick string can't be a call's argument without parentheses (`` print(`x`) ``) |
| If-expressions | `local speed = if running then 200 else 100` | `elseif` allowed, `else` required; only the chosen branch is evaluated |

Code that uses them won't run on desktop LÖVE. `findSmittenSyntax` in
`web/editor/smitten-syntax.js` lists where a file uses each of them
(`node tools/smitten-syntax/test.mjs` tests it).

### Compatibility check

The editor checks a project's Lua files each time it runs or exports, and
`package.py` does the same when packaging. Problems appear in the console
(or on stderr) with the file and line: LuaJIT-only and networking modules
required without `pcall`, 64-bit literals, compute shaders, `io.popen` and
`os.execute`, unguarded `jit.*` calls, plus notes about
`love.system.getOS()` returning `"Web"` and threads sharing one core. The
rules are in `web/editor/compat-rules.json`.

## The Lua JIT

`deps/lua-5.1.5/ljit.inc` compiles a Lua function to a small WebAssembly
module once it has been called, or has looped, 50 times. The browser then
compiles that to machine code like any other wasm.

- Lua values stay in the Lua stack, exactly where the interpreter keeps
  them, so compiled code can be entered and left at any instruction: after
  calls, when a coroutine resumes, from the middle of a hot loop, or to hand
  a frame back to the interpreter when a debug hook is set.
- Arithmetic, comparisons, numeric `for` loops, tests, moves, constants, and
  reads and writes of table fields (constant string keys, hashed at compile
  time) and array slots run inline. Everything that can involve metatables,
  the GC, errors or calls goes to helpers that are copies of the
  interpreter's own code, so behavior (including error messages) is
  identical.
- Compiled functions call other compiled functions directly, up to 64 deep.
- Frames with a line or count hook are interpreted, so `debug.sethook` and
  `love.thread`'s scheduler work unchanged.
- `?jit=0` on the player turns it off.

`tools/jit/` builds the standalone interpreter for Node and runs a
differential test suite: every test must print exactly the same with the
JIT off, compiling everything immediately, and with a mix of compiled and
interpreted frames.

```bash
sh tools/jit/build-node.sh
```

```bash
bash tools/jit/test.sh
```

## Building

Requires the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
(tested with 6.0.13) and Python 3.10+.

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
```

```bash
python3 build.py
```

Builds are incremental (about 430 source files the first time). The build
also embeds the `smitten` module's Lua files in the engine and compiles the
synthesizer a second time, on its own, as `dist/synth.mjs` for the editor's
previews. Other options:

- `python3 build.py --debug` for assertions and no optimization
- `python3 build.py --web-only` to copy only the player, editor and examples into `dist/`
- `python3 build.py --profiling` to keep function names for size analysis (writes to `build/profiling/`)

Then serve `dist/`:

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

and open http://localhost:8766/ for the editor or
http://localhost:8766/player.html?game=examples/hello.love for the player.

The `smitten` module's test games print a pass count:
`tools/smitten-sprite`, `tools/smitten-map` and `tools/smitten-audio` (whose
`check.mjs` confirms the engine and `synth.mjs` render identical samples).
The test games in `tools/` run with `python3 tools/test_server.py 8772`,
which zips them on request and adds the routes the `https` test needs:
http://localhost:8772/player.html?game=tools/https.love (or `smoke`,
`filedialog`, `textinput`, ...).

## The editor

`dist/index.html`. Everything is stored in the browser (IndexedDB); nothing is
uploaded anywhere unless you share a link.

- Projects with a file tree showing thumbnails; import files, folders,
  `.love` and `.zip` by drag and drop. **New** (the + in the file panel)
  makes files, folders and assets (sprite, map, tileset, sound effect, song)
- Dragging a file into the code inserts the code that loads it
  (`smitten.sprite("sprites/hero")`, `require("entities.player")`, ...)
- Renaming or moving an asset fixes the paths in maps, tilesets, sprites and
  songs that point at it, moves a PNG's `.sprite.json` along, and offers to
  update code that loads it
- The built-in tools open their files in tabs; **Open as text** in a file's
  menu shows the JSON instead
- CodeMirror 6 editor with Lua and Smitten syntax highlighting, and
  completion for LÖVE 12 (generated by introspecting the real engine,
  `web/editor/tools/introspect.html`), the `smitten` module and asset paths
- Run (F5 or Ctrl+Enter), Stop, Restart, Pause, run after saving, pop-out window
- Command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or F1), go to file (Ctrl+P), go to function
  (Ctrl+Shift+O), go to line from the status bar
- Settings (Ctrl+,): theme, font size, indentation, word wrap, line numbers,
  whitespace, bracket closing, suggestions, auto save, game scaling, the Lua
  JIT, console options, and a list of every keyboard shortcut
- Console with clickable `file:line` errors, filtering, and copying the output
- Web compatibility check on every run and export
- Export for the web (a zip for itch.io), download the project as a zip,
  download a `.love` (with a warning when the game needs Smitten), and share
  links for small projects (text plus small images, up to 32 KB compressed)
- Examples: the Smitten platformer, plus Cupid's LÖVE examples (platformer,
  particles, shaders, physics, text input, canvas and blend modes, synth)
- Works on narrow screens

The editor loads CodeMirror from esm.sh, so the first load needs an internet
connection (it falls back to a plain text area if that fails).

## Publishing a game

Copy `player.html`, `player.js`, `player.css`, `love.mjs` and `love.wasm` next
to your `game.love`, and add this to `player.html`'s `<head>`:

```html
<meta name="love-game" content="game.love">
```

The editor's **Export for web** does this for you, as does the command line:

```bash
python3 package.py path/to/game out/ --zip
```

Either produces a zip you can upload to itch.io as an HTML game. Serving `.wasm` as `application/wasm`
lets browsers compile the engine while it downloads; most hosts already do.

Player URL options:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `?game=url` | Load a `.love` from a URL |
| `?autoplay=1` | Skip the Play button (audio may stay muted until the first click) |
| `?scale=fit` (default) / `integer` / `none` | How a fixed-size window is scaled to the page |
| `?pixelated=1` | Nearest-neighbour upscaling (also implied by `scale=integer`) |
| `?embed=1` | Embedded mode, controlled with `postMessage` (see `web/player/player.js`) |

## Web-specific behavior

- `love.system.getOS()` returns `"Web"`.
- Save files live in IndexedDB and are flushed every 2 seconds, when the tab
  is hidden, and when the game quits.
- `love.timer.sleep` on the main thread doesn't block (it lets threads run instead).
- Text input is enabled by default, as on desktop, except on touch devices
  (no hover, coarse pointer), where it starts off as on Android and iOS.
  While it's on, a hidden text field has keyboard focus instead of the
  canvas, so IME composition (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), emoji pickers,
  dictation and on-screen keyboards reach `love.textinput` (composition in
  progress is reported to `love.textedited`). `love.keypressed` works as
  before; keys that belong to an IME composition don't produce key presses.
  Pasting into the field is ignored, as on desktop: use
  `love.system.getClipboardText`.
- On touch devices, tap the game while text input is on to bring up the
  on-screen keyboard (browsers only show it in response to a tap).
  `love.keyboard.setTextInput(true, x, y, w, h)` moves the hidden field over
  that rectangle, which is where IME candidate windows appear.
- `require("https")` (lua-https) works, using a synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`:
  it blocks like on desktop. Browser rules apply: other sites must allow
  cross-origin requests (CORS), an `https` page can't request `http` URLs,
  and some request headers (`User-Agent`, `Content-Length`, ...) are set by
  the browser. Network errors, including refused CORS requests, return
  status `0` with an error message as the body (like lua-https on macOS).
  Response header names are lower case. Relative URLs are resolved against
  the page, so a game can request files hosted next to it.
- `love.window.showFileDialog` uses the browser's file picker.
  - `openfile` and `openfolder` copy what was picked into the in-memory file
    system (`/picked/<n>/...`) and return those paths; read them as on
    desktop with `love.filesystem.openNativeFile`, `mountFullPath` or
    `io.open`. Filters become the picker's `accept` list; browsers can't
    show a title or button labels.
  - `savefile` returns `/picked/<n>/<defaultname>`. When the game has
    written and closed that file, the browser downloads it under that name
    (again on every later save to it).
  - Cancelling returns an empty list, as on desktop.
  - Browsers only open pickers in response to a click or key press. If the
    game calls `showFileDialog` from `love.keypressed` or
    `love.mousepressed`, the picker opens directly (in browsers that report
    `navigator.userActivation`). Otherwise, and always for `savefile`, the
    player shows a small bar with a "Choose file…" / "Save" button and
    Cancel; the picker opens when it's clicked.
- Games with `t.window.resizable = true` fill the page and get `love.resize`.
- `love.window.setFullscreen` resizes the game immediately; the browser
  enters real fullscreen on the next click or key press (browsers only allow
  fullscreen from a user gesture).

## Not supported

- Networking modules: `socket` (LuaSocket) and `enet` (browsers have no raw
  sockets). `https` works, see above.
- WOFF2 fonts (FreeType is built without Brotli); TTF and OTF work.
- LuaJIT itself and its `ffi` library (Lua runs on PUC Lua 5.1 with LuaJIT's
  language extensions and this project's own JIT; see "Lua compatibility").
- Compute shaders (WebGL 2 has none).

## How it works

`web/native/web_main.cpp` replaces LÖVE's `main()`. On desktop LÖVE resumes
its boot coroutine in a `while` loop. `boot.lua` yields once per iteration of
`love.run`'s main loop, so on the web that coroutine is resumed once per
`requestAnimationFrame` instead. LÖVE's own Lua code changes only where
noted below.

The engine patches (`git diff dca79b4 -- love deps`) are kept small so they
can be rebased onto newer LÖVE commits:

- Add an `LOVE_EMSCRIPTEN` platform (`config.h`) and leave out LuaSocket
  and ENet.
- lua-https gets a browser backend
  (`love/src/libraries/luahttps/src/emscripten`, requests made in
  `web/native/library_love.js`).
- WebGL 2 differences: no texture swizzle (LA8 textures use
  `LUMINANCE_ALPHA`), no `GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB` toggle.
- `love.timer` uses `emscripten_get_now`; sleeping doesn't block.
- A Lua-to-WebAssembly JIT (above), in `deps/lua-5.1.5/ljit.inc` with small hooks in `lvm.c`, `ldo.c` and `lfunc.c`.
- Green threads for `love.thread` (above); audio streaming refills from the
  frame loop and a timer instead of a pool thread, and recovers from underruns.
- `love.video` decodes Theora from the frame loop too, instead of its worker
  thread. libtheora's decoder is built from source (`deps/theora`, without
  its x86/ARM assembly); libogg is Emscripten's port.
- A streaming Source seeked while paused or stopped no longer skips ahead
  when played again (this showed up as a video with audio jumping ahead).
- `boot.lua` skips modules the build doesn't include.
- LuaBitOp (`deps/luabitop`) is loaded as the global `bit`, as on LuaJIT.
- SDL3 text input is started when the window is created (not on touch
  devices). Text from the page's hidden text field is pushed as SDL text
  events by `web/native/web_main.cpp`.
- `love.window.showFileDialog` hands the dialog to `library_love.js`
  instead of SDL (`love/src/modules/window/sdl/Window.cpp`).

### Smitten's additions

Smitten extends LÖVE without changing what `love.*` does (DESIGN.md,
section 3):

- `love/src/modules/smitten/`: the `smitten` module. `wrap_Smitten.cpp`
  registers it next to LÖVE's modules (`love.cpp`, under `LOVE_SMITTEN`) and
  loads its Lua files, which `build.py` embeds from `lua/` as
  `build/gen/smitten_lua.h`. Each file is loaded the first time a game uses
  what it provides. `boot.lua` makes the module the global `smitten` once
  LÖVE's modules are loaded.
- `Synth.cpp` renders sound effects and songs (no LÖVE dependencies, so the
  same code is built into `synth.mjs` for the editor), and `LoopDecoder.cpp`
  plays a rendered song with a seamless loop as a streaming Source.
- `deps/lua-5.1.5`: Smitten's syntax in `llex.c` and `lparser.c`, and the
  original `tostring` kept in the registry for interpolation.
- The player keeps save files under its own data folder
  (`XDG_DATA_HOME`), and the editor uses its own storage names, so
  Smitten never shares projects, settings or saves with Cupid or other
  LÖVE players on the same site.

## Licenses

LÖVE is under the zlib license (`love/license.txt`); its bundled libraries
keep their own licenses. Lua 5.1 is MIT (`deps/lua-5.1.5/COPYRIGHT`), as is
LuaBitOp (`deps/luabitop/bit.c`). libtheora is BSD-style
